# FilePreview

`FilePreview` widget is used for file viewing. It always occupies 50% of the main screen area and is placed next to other content. The widget is fixed at the top of the screen while scrolling, ensuring the document remains visible.

* Displays only the [fileUpload](https://doc.cxbox.org/widget/fields/field/fileUpload/fileUpload/) field type  
* Supports a new mode:inline for the fileUpload field, displaying the document directly within the page without opening a popup  
* The allocated area remains fixed even if no file is uploaded  
* The area cannot be collapsed  

!!! info
    Due to its fixed position, placing other widgets directly below it on the same vertical axis is not possible.
