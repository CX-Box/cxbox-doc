# Show condition
The `showCondition` is used to define the availability or visibility of the widget dynamically.
The `showCondition` in configuration represents the condition under which the widge will be made visible to the user. 
It controls whether the widget appears on the user interface based on the value of a specific field in another or currentbusiness component.

* `no show condition - recommended`: widget always visible
* `show condition by current entity`: condition can include boolean expression depending on current entity fields. Field updates will trigger condition recalculation only on save or if field is force active
* `show condition by parent entity`: condition can include boolean expression depending on parent entity. Parent field updates will trigger condition recalculation only on save or if field is force active shown on same view

!!! tips
    It is recommended not to use `Show condition` when possible, because wide usage of this feature makes application hard to support.
